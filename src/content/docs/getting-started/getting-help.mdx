Need help with DiSky? This guide will show you how to get support effectively.

## Support Policy

<Aside type="danger" title="Version Support">
  We only provide support for DiSky's latest **stable** version. If you're using an older version, please update before asking for help.
</Aside>

## Before Asking for Help

Before asking a question, please:

1. **Check the documentation** - Your answer might be in this wiki
2. **Search existing issues** - Someone might have had the same problem
3. **Read error messages** - They often contain helpful information
4. **Update to the latest version** - Your issue might already be fixed

## Where to Get Help

### Discord Server (Recommended)

Join our [Discord server](https://disky.me/discord) for quick help from the community.

- Go to the `#support` channel
- Follow the requirements below when asking
- Be patient and polite while waiting for a response

### GitHub Issues

For bug reports and feature requests, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky/issues).

- Check if your issue already exists
- Provide all required information
- Use issue templates when available

## What to Include

When asking for help, **always** include:

### 1. DiSky Version

Run this command and include the output:

```
/ver disky
```

### 2. Bot Intents

Run this command with your bot's name and include the output:

```
/disky bot <bot-name>
```

Replace `<bot-name>` with the name you used in your `define new bot named "..."` structure.

### 3. Error Messages

If you're getting errors:
- Include the **FULL** error message
- Don't just say "it doesn't work" - show us the actual error
- Include any console output related to the issue

### 4. Your Code

Share the relevant code that's causing the issue:
- Use proper code formatting (Discord markdown or GitHub Gists)
- Include enough context, but remove sensitive information (like bot tokens!)
- Show what you expected to happen vs. what actually happened

## Example Help Request

Here's a good example of a help request:

```
**DiSky Version**: 4.17.0
**Skript Version**: 2.7.2
**Bot Intents**: [output from /disky bot MyBot]

**Problem**: My bot isn't receiving slash command interactions

**Error**: [paste full error here]

**Code**:
[paste your code here, with token removed]

**Expected**: The bot should respond when I use /hello
**Actual**: Nothing happens when I use the command
```

## Response Times

Our community helps voluntarily, so response times may vary:
- **Peak hours**: Usually faster responses
- **Complex issues**: May take longer to investigate
- **Weekends/holidays**: Slower responses

Be patient and don't spam your question. Bumping after 24+ hours is acceptable.

## What NOT to Do

❌ **Don't** ask if anyone can help - just ask your question directly
❌ **Don't** DM community members - ask in public channels
❌ **Don't** share your bot token publicly
❌ **Don't** expect instant responses
❌ **Don't** ask the same question multiple times
❌ **Don't** use `/reload` and then ask why things broke

## Self-Help Resources

Before asking, try these resources:

- [FAQ](/getting-started/faq/) - Common questions answered
- [Examples](/examples/basic/) - Code examples for common tasks
- [Discord API Docs](https://discord.com/developers/docs) - Official Discord documentation
- [Skript Hub](https://skripthub.net/docs/) - Skript syntax reference
