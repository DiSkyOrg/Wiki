---

DiSky is a comprehensive Skript addon that enables you to create and manage Discord bots entirely within Skript. It provides an extensive set of features to interact with Discord's API without requiring any Java programming knowledge.

## Why DiSky?

If you're familiar with Skript for Minecraft server scripting, DiSky brings that same intuitive syntax to Discord bot development. This means:

- **No Java Required**: Write Discord bots using familiar Skript syntax
- **Rapid Development**: Create complex bots quickly with high-level abstractions
- **Minecraft Integration**: Seamlessly connect your Minecraft server with Discord
- **Extensive Features**: Support for messages, interactions, voice, modals, and more

## Key Features

### Messages & Embeds
Send simple text messages, rich embeds with images and fields, and upload files to Discord channels.

### Slash Commands & Interactions
Full support for Discord's modern interaction system including slash commands, buttons, select menus, and modals.

### Event-Driven
Listen to Discord events like messages, reactions, member joins, and more, just like Skript events.

### Asynchronous Operations
Handle Discord API calls asynchronously to keep your server running smoothly without lag or blocking.

### Advanced Configuration
Fine-tune your bot's behavior with gateway intents, cache policies, and more.

- **Minecraft Server**: A Minecraft server (Spigot, Paper, etc.)
