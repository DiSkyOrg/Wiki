This page answers the most frequently asked questions about DiSky. If your question isn't answered here, check out our [Getting Help](/getting-started/getting-help/) page.

## Bot Setup & Connection

### Why doesn't my bot come online?

**Possible causes:**

1. **Invalid token** - Double-check your bot token is correct
2. **Missing intents** - Enable required intents in Discord Developer Portal
3. **Skript version** - Ensure you're using Skript 2.14+
4. **Error in console** - Check console for error messages

<Aside type="tip">
  Run `/ver disky` and `/ver skript` to check your versions.
</Aside>

### I get "CloseCode 4014" or "Disallowed intents" error

You need to enable privileged intents in the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Go to your [application dashboard](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
2. Select your bot application
3. Go to the "Bot" section
4. Scroll to "Privileged Gateway Intents"
5. Enable required intents (Server Members, Message Content, Presence)

## Slash Commands

### My slash commands aren't updating/appearing

This usually happens because of one of these reasons:

1. **Missing scope** - When inviting your bot, make sure to include the `applications.commands` scope in the OAuth2 URL
2. **Cache delay** - Discord can take up to 1 hour to update slash commands globally
3. **Wrong registration** - Make sure you're registering commands in the correct `on ready` section

<Aside type="caution">
  Global commands can take up to 1 hour to update. Guild-specific commands update instantly.
</Aside>

### How do I make guild-specific slash commands?

Register them in the `on guild ready` section instead of `on ready`:

```applescript
define new bot named "MyBot":
    token: "..."

    on guild ready:
        # Register guild-specific commands here
```

## Data & Storage

### I get "entity cannot be stored" error

Discord entities (users, channels, guilds, etc.) cannot be saved to variables that persist across restarts.

**Solution**: Save the entity's **ID** instead, then retrieve it when needed:

```applescript
# Bad - won't work
set {savedUser} to event-user

# Good - save the ID
set {savedUserID} to id of event-user

# Later, retrieve it
set {_user} to user with id {savedUserID} in event-bot
```

## Users & Members

### What's the difference between users and members?

- **User**: A Discord account (has: ID, username, avatar, discriminator)
- **Member**: A user in a specific guild (has: everything a user has + nickname, roles, permissions)

A member always has an associated user, but a user isn't always a member of a guild.

```applescript
# Get user from member
set {_user} to user of {_member}

# Get member from user (requires guild context)
set {_member} to {_user} as member of {_guild}
```

### I can't change a member's nickname

This is a **hierarchy issue**. You can only modify members with a lower highest role than:
- Your bot's highest role, OR
- The member you're modifying (if they're the executor)

<Aside type="caution" title="Server Owners">
  Server owners always have the highest possible role. You cannot modify their nickname or roles.
</Aside>

### How does DiSky handle the new username system?

As of DiSky v4.12.1+:
- Discriminators are removed from display names
- `%event-member%` returns just the username (e.g., `itsthesky`)
- The discriminator expression/event is still available for compatibility

## Parsing & Retrieving

### Why can't I use `"123" parsed as user`?

Most Discord entities require **context** to be retrieved:
- Users need a **bot** context
- Channels need a **guild** context
- Members need a **guild** context

**Solution**: Use getter/retriever expressions instead:

```applescript
# Get user by ID
set {_user} to user with id "123456789" in bot "MyBot"

# Get channel by ID
set {_channel} to channel with id "987654321" in guild {_guild}

# Get member by ID
set {_member} to member with id "123456789" in guild {_guild}
```

Check the [syntax documentation](https://docs.disky.me/) for available getters and retrievers.

## Performance & Best Practices

### Should I cache everything?

No. Only cache what you need:

- Use `default cache` for most bots
- Enable specific caches only if you need them
- More caching = more memory usage

See [Cache Policy](/basics/cache-policy/) for details.

### Can I use `/reload` to reload my bot?

**No!** Using `/reload` can cause serious issues with plugins.

**Always**:
- Use `/sk reload <script>` to reload specific scripts, OR
- Restart your server completely

<Aside type="danger">
  No support will be provided if you use `/reload` and encounter issues.
</Aside>

## Messages & Interactions

### Why can't my bot read message content?

You need to enable the **Message Content Intent**:

1. In Discord Developer Portal
2. Go to your bot's settings
3. Enable "Message Content Intent" under Privileged Gateway Intents
4. Update your bot's intents in code:

```applescript
define new bot named "MyBot":
    intents: all intents  # or specifically include message content intent
```

### My bot isn't responding to interactions

Check these common issues:

1. **Replied too late** - You have 3 seconds to respond to interactions
2. **Already replied** - You can only reply once to an interaction
3. **Not deferring** - For long operations, defer the interaction first
4. **Missing intents** - Ensure required intents are enabled

## Addons & Compatibility

### Does DiSky work with other Skript addons?

Generally yes, but conflicts can occur:
- DiSky tries to avoid conflicts with Skript itself
- Some syntax might conflict with other addons
- Report any conflicts on our [Discord](https://disky.me/discord)

### Which Skript version should I use?

Use **Skript 2.14+** (required). We recommend the [official SkriptLang fork](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/latest).

<Aside type="caution" title="DiSky Version Compatibility">
  DiSky version compatibility with Skript:
  - For Skript versions 2.10 to 2.13 (inclusive), use DiSky v4.26 or lower
  - DiSky v4.27 and above will only work with Skript v2.14 and higher
  - No support will be provided for older versions of DiSky
</Aside>

2. Search in our [Discord server](https://disky.me/discord)
3. Ask in the `#support` channel following the [Getting Help](/getting-started/getting-help/) guidelines

<Aside type="tip">
  Most issues can be solved by checking your intents, updating to the latest version, and reading error messages carefully!
