This guide will walk you through installing DiSky on your Minecraft server.

## Requirements

Before installing DiSky, ensure you have:

- A Minecraft server (Spigot, Paper, or similar)
- **Skript 2.10 or higher** installed
- Basic knowledge of Skript syntax

<Aside type="caution" title="Skript Version Required">
  DiSky requires Skript version **2.10 or higher**. Older versions are not supported.
</Aside>

## Recommended Skript Version

We recommend using [the official Skript fork](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/latest) maintained by SkriptLang. This fork is actively maintained and provides the best compatibility with DiSky.

## Installation Steps

<Steps>

1. **Download Skript**

   If you haven't already, download [Skript 2.10+](https://github.com/SkriptLang/Skript/releases/latest) and place it in your `plugins/` folder.

2. **Download DiSky**

   Download the latest version of DiSky from:
   - [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/plugin/disky) (recommended)
   - [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky/releases)

3. **Install the Plugin**

   Place the DiSky jar file in your server's `plugins/` folder alongside Skript.

4. **Restart Your Server**

   Restart your server completely. **Do not use `/reload`** as it can cause issues.

   <Aside type="danger" title="Don't Use /reload">
     Using `/reload` can cause serious issues with plugins. Always restart your server properly.
   </Aside>

5. **Verify Installation**

   After the server restarts, check the console for DiSky's startup message. You can also run `/plugins` to verify both Skript and DiSky are loaded.

</Steps>

## Configuration

DiSky does not require any configuration files. All bot configuration is done through Skript code, which you'll learn in the next section.

<Aside type="tip">
  If you need specific configuration options for certain features, you can request them on our [Discord server](https://disky.me/discord) or [GitHub repository](https://github.com/DiSkyOrg/DiSky).
</Aside>

## Add-on Compatibility

DiSky is a comprehensive addon that adds many features to Skript. Some syntax may conflict with other Skript addons.

- DiSky tries to avoid conflicts with **Skript itself**
- Conflicts with other addons are possible but rare
- If you encounter conflicts, report them on our [Discord](https://disky.me/discord)

## Next Steps

Now that DiSky is installed, you're ready to create your first Discord bot!
