A Minecraft book is composed of an author, a title and **pages**. Each page can be formatted using **MiniMessage**'s formatting, and can contain clickable links, hover effects and more.

## Create the book

First, let's create the book itself. You can use the following expression to do so:

```applescript
set {_book} to a new book with title "My Book" and author "ItsTheSky" #(1)!
```

1. You can use **[MiniMessage's formatting](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html)** here too! For instance:

    ```applescript
    set {_book} to a new book with title "<gradient:red:blue>My Title" and author "&6Its&cThe&9Sky"
    ```

<Aside type="tip">
  You can replace any `book` in the elements of the addon by `boosk` to avoid conflicts with other addons!
</Aside>

## Add pages

Now, we can add pages to our book. One element added to the pages represents one actual page of the book!

```applescript
# First page (with gradient)
add "Hey there! <gradient:red:gold>I am a nice gradient :D</gradient>" to pages of {_book}

# Second page (with clickable link)
add "I am a <click:suggest_command:/say Hello!>clickable link</click>!" to pages of {_book}

# Third page (with hover effect)
add "I am a <hover:show_text:'&cI am a hover effect!'>hover effect</hover>!" to pages of {_book}
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Enhance the process with lists">
  You can use **lists** to simplify the process of adding pages to a book:

  ```applescript
  add "First line" to {_pages::*}
  add "Second line" to {_pages::*}
  # ...
  add (join {_pages::*} with nl) to pages of {_book}
  ```

  We'll just join, at the end, all the elements with a new line. Smart, right?
</Aside>

## Open the book

You can finally open the book to one or more players, using the following effect:

```applescript
open boosk {_book} to player
```

## Result

This code will have the following results:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="First page">
    ![First page](../images/boosk/first-page.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Second page">
    ![Second page](../images/boosk/second-page.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Third page">
    ![Third page](../images/boosk/third-page.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Give the book

Optionally, you can give the book as an item to a player. You can use the following expression to convert your book into a Skript's item:

```applescript
set {_item} to book {_book} as item

# ... and then for instance:
# give {_item} to player
```
