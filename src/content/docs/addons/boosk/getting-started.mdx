**BooSK** is a Skript addon made for **book** manipulation, from 1.16.X to latest version. It supports legacy and **[MiniMessage's formatting](https://docs.advntr.dev/minimessage/format.html)**, so you can make clickable links, gradients, hover effects and more.

## Requirements

- Skript `v2.14.X` or higher
- ~~Spigot~~/Paper `1.16.X` or higher

<Aside type="caution">
  We do not support CraftBukkit or any other fork that are not based on Paper! Spigot will soon be dropped as well.
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
  **Information related to Skript's manipulation**
  BooSK will change Skript's code using reflection, more specifically the `open book` effect (for obvious reasons).

  Although BooSK should also implement the default Skript behavior, it's not guaranteed to work for every case. Feel free to report any issues to the developer as soon as you've discovered something unusual!
