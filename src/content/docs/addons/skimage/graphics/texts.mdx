In order to draw text, you'll have to create its object, configure its properties, and then draw it.

## Creating and configuring fonts

The first thing to do is creating the font that will be used to draw the text. You can create a font with the following expression:

```applescript
set {_font} to new font named "Arial" with size 20
```

<Aside type="caution">
  The font name is case-sensitive. You can find the list of available fonts on your system by using the following expression:

  ```applescript
  all fonts
  ```
</Aside>

### Adding font styles

You can add a style to the font by using the following expression:

```applescript
set {_font} to new font named "Arial" and style "XXX" with size 20
```

You can replace the `XXX` with the following styles:

- `bold`
- `italic`
- `plain`
- `bold italic`

### Using custom fonts

You must **load** the font before using it. It's best to put the following effect inside a `on load` or `on skript load` event:

```applescript
register text font from file "path/to/font.ttf" # single file
register text font from file "path/to/fonts/" # folder (all files inside will be loaded)
```

Supported formats are `.ttf`, `.otf` and `.ttc`.

## Creating and drawing text

Now that you have a font, you can create the text object:

```applescript
set {_text} to new text with font {_font} and text "Hello world!"
```

SkImage uses a powerful 'text format' system, therefore you can easily change the text's color by using Minecraft's colors, for example:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Code">
    ```applescript
    set {_txt} to new text "$cHello $6world! $##00FF00This is green!%nl%$3works on multiple lines!" with font {_font} vert align horiz align
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Result">
    ![text.png](../images_files/text-1.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

As you can see here, you can use `$` to change the color of the text (using Minecraft's color codes, or HEX codes), and `%nl%` to create a new line. Also, you can specify either the vertical or horizontal alignment of the text.

You can now draw the text as when you draw a shape:

```applescript
draw {_text} on {_graphics} at 0, 0
```

<Aside>
  If you **center the text**, the input position will be considered as 'offset' from the center of the text.

  Therefore, if you want your text perfectly centered, you'll have to set 0, 0 for the position when drawing the text!

## Supported Color Codes

### Minecraft codes

- `$0` - Black

### HEX Code

The format is `$#000000` where `000000` is the HEX code.

<Aside type="note">
  For drawing text with semi-transparent colors, you need:

  - An image with RGBA format (see [image types](../images/images#loading-or-creating-an-image) for more information)
  - The proper composite effect set (see [composite effects](./customizations#composite-effects) for details)
