## Anti-aliasing

Anti-aliasing is a technique used to make the edges of shapes smoother:

![anti-aliases.png](../images_files/anti-aliases.png)

**It is disabled by default.** If you wish to enable it for both shapes & text, you can simply set the property to true, for instance:

```applescript
set anti-aliasing of {_graphics} to true
```

You can simply turn it off by setting it to false.

<Aside>
  This will be taken in account for all shapes & text drawn **after** the property has been set!

## Stroke

The stroke is the outline of a shape, or how the *line* shape is drawn. By default, it has a width of 1 and is filled.

A stroke can have several properties:

- `width`: the width of the stroke (in pixel)
- `cap` (optional): the cap of the stroke. Can be `butt`, `round` or `square`. Defaults to `round`.
- `join` (optional): the join of the stroke. Can be `bevel`, `miter` or `round`. Defaults to `round`.
- `mitter limit` (optional): the mitter limit of the stroke. Defaults to 10.
- `dash array` (optional): the dash array of the stroke. Defaults to `none` (aka full line).
- `dash phase` (optional): the dash phase of the stroke. Defaults to 0.

Here's some example code when drawing a rectangle: (anti-aliasing is enabled)

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Width of 5">
    ```applescript
    set stroke of {_graphics} to new stroke with width 5
    ```

    ![stroke-1.png](../images_files/stroke-1.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Width of 5, Dashed">
    ```applescript
    set stroke of {_graphics} to new basic stroke with width 5 and miter limit 10 and dash array (2, 7) and dash phase 0
    ```

    ![stroke-2.png](../images_files/stroke-2.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Width of 5, Dashed, Rounded">
    ```applescript
    set stroke of {_graphics} to new basic stroke with width 5 and cap "round" and join "round" and dash array (2, 7) and dash phase 0
    ```

    ![stroke-3.png](../images_files/stroke-3.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Composite Effects

Composite effects determine how newly drawn content blends with existing content on the graphics canvas. You can change the composite effect of a graphics object using:

```applescript
set composite [effect] of {_graphics} to <effect>
```

Where `<effect>` is one of the following constants:

### Available Composite Effects

- **over**: Places the source over the destination, respecting transparency. This is the default composite operation in most graphics contexts.

- **add**: Displays the source where it overlaps with the destination, preserving the destination's alpha. Useful for drawing within the bounds of an existing shape.

- **clear**: Clears all pixels in the destination area where the source is drawn. Creates transparent areas regardless of what was there before.

- **copy**: Replaces the destination with the source completely, ignoring what was previously drawn. Only the new content remains visible.

- **destination**: Preserves the destination and ignores the source completely. Drawing operations have no visible effect when this composite is active.

- **destination_atop**: Keeps the destination where it overlaps with the source, and displays the source elsewhere. The result shows destination content within source bounds.

- **destination_in**: Keeps only the parts of the destination that overlap with the source. Creates masked effects where destination is only visible through the "shape" of the source.

- **destination_out**: Keeps only the parts of the destination that don't overlap with the source. Effectively "punches holes" in the destination using the source as a mask.

- **destination_over**: Places the destination over the source. New content appears behind existing content, as if drawing underneath existing elements.

### Example Usage

```applescript
# Set the composite effect to allow transparency when drawing
set composite of {_graphics} to over

# Draw a semi-transparent rectangle
draw filled shape (new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and color (color from rgb 255, 0, 0, 128)) on {_graphics} at 10, 10

# Change composite for a masking effect
set composite of {_graphics} to destination_in
draw filled shape (new circle with radius 50 and color black) on {_graphics} at 50, 50
```

<Aside type="note">
  For proper transparency effects:

  1. Your image must be created with RGBA support (use `TYPE_INT_ARGB` - type 1 when creating images)
  2. The composite effect needs to be set appropriately for the desired blending

  See [image types](../images/images#loading-or-creating-an-image) for more information on creating images with transparency support.
</Aside>

### When to Use Different Composites

- **over**: For normal drawing with transparency support
- **add/src_atop**: For combining elements where you want to preserve destination alpha
- **clear**: For creating transparent cutouts
- **copy**: For completely replacing content
- **destination_in/destination_out**: For masking effects
- **destination_over**: For drawing behind existing content
