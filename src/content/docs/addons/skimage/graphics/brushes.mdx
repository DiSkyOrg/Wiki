Instead of simple colors, you can use brushes to create more complex fills for your shapes. Brushes allow you to create gradients, patterns, textures, and other visual effects.

<Aside type="note">
  For drawing with semi-transparent colors using brushes, you need:

  - An image with RGBA format (see [image types](../images/images#loading-or-creating-an-image) for more information)
  - The proper composite effect set (see [composite effects](./customizations#composite-effects) for details)
</Aside>

## Solid Color Brush

The most basic brush is a solid color:

```applescript
set {_brush} to new solid brush with color red
set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
```

## Gradient Brushes

Gradient brushes create a smooth transition between multiple colors:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Horizontal Gradient">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new horizontal gradient brush with colors red, yellow, blue
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vertical Gradient">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new vertical gradient brush with colors red, yellow, blue
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Radial Gradient">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new radial gradient brush with colors red, yellow, blue
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Pattern Brushes

Pattern brushes create repeating patterns:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Checkerboard Pattern">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new checkerboard pattern brush with primary color black and secondary color white and size 10
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Dots Pattern">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new dots pattern brush with primary color black and secondary color white and size 8
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Stripes Pattern">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new stripes pattern brush with primary color black and secondary color white and size 8
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Hatch Brushes

Hatch brushes create line-based patterns:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Horizontal Hatch">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new horizontal hatch brush with primary color black and secondary color white and spacing 5
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Vertical Hatch">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new vertical hatch brush with primary color black and secondary color white and spacing 5
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Diagonal Hatch">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new diagonal hatch brush with primary color black and secondary color white and spacing 5
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Cross Hatch">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new cross hatch brush with primary color black and secondary color white and spacing 5
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Dotted Hatch">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new dotted hatch brush with primary color black and secondary color white and spacing 5
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Special Effect Brushes

These brushes create more complex visual effects:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Marble Brush">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new marble brush with primary color blue and secondary color white and turbulence 0.5
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Metallic Brush">
    ```applescript
    # Create a gold-like metallic effect
    set {_brush} to new metallic brush with color rgb(212, 175, 55) and shininess 0.7
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Noise Brush">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new noise brush with color green and intensity 0.5
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Reflective Brush">
    ```applescript
    set {_brush} to new reflective brush with color silver and light at x 20, y 20 and intensity 0.8
    set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Texture Brush

You can use an existing image as a texture brush:

```applescript
set {_texture} to image from file "plugins/SkImage2/textures/grass.png"
set {_brush} to new texture brush from {_texture}
set {_shape} to new rectangle with width 80 and height 80 and brush {_brush}
```
