SkImage provides a powerful set of image effects that can be applied to images to transform their appearance. These effects can be combined to create complex visual transformations.

<Aside type="tip">
  **Performance Consideration**
  Image effects can be processing-intensive, especially for large images. If you have DiSky installed, it's highly recommended to use the `await set {_img} ...` prefix for effect operations to prevent server lag.
</Aside>

## Applying Effects

You can apply an effect to an image using the following syntax:

```applescript
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

You can also chain multiple effects:

```applescript
set {_img} to {_img} with effects {_effect1} and {_effect2}
```

## Available Effects

### Blur Effect

Creates a gaussian blur effect that softens the image.

```applescript
set {_effect} to blur effect with radius 5
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

The `radius` parameter determines how strong the blur is. Higher values create a more pronounced blur effect.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Brightness Effect

Adjusts the brightness of an image.

```applescript
set {_effect} to brightness effect with factor 1.5
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

The `factor` parameter:
- Values greater than 1.0 increase brightness
- Values less than 1.0 decrease brightness
- A factor of 1.0 maintains the original brightness

    ![Original](/images/skimage/effects/original.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Increased Brightness (+40%)">
    ![Increased Brightness](/images/skimage/effects/6_Brightness_40.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Decreased Brightness (-40%)">
    ![Decreased Brightness](/images/skimage/effects/7_Brightness_40.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Contrast Effect

Adjusts the contrast of an image.

```applescript
set {_effect} to contrast effect with factor 1.5
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

The `factor` parameter:
- Values greater than 1.0 increase contrast
- Values less than 1.0 decrease contrast
- A factor of 1.0 maintains the original contrast

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With Contrast Effect">
    ![Contrast Effect](/images/skimage/effects/8_Contrast.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Grayscale Effect

Converts an image to grayscale (black and white).

```applescript
set {_effect} to grayscale effect with intensity 0.8
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

The `intensity` parameter (0.0 to 1.0) controls how much of the original color is removed:
- 1.0 creates a fully grayscale image
- 0.0 leaves the image unchanged
- Values in between create a partial grayscale effect

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With Grayscale Effect">
    ![Grayscale Effect](/images/skimage/effects/1_Grayscale.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Sepia Effect

Applies a warm brown tone to the image, creating a vintage or aged look.

```applescript
set {_effect} to sepia effect with intensity 0.7
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

The `intensity` parameter (0.0 to 1.0) controls the strength of the sepia effect.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With Sepia Effect">
    ![Sepia Effect](/images/skimage/effects/2_Sepia.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Color Tint Effect

Applies a color tint to the image.

```applescript
set {_effect} to color tint effect with color red and intensity 0.3
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

Parameters:
- `color`: The color to apply as a tint (can be a Skript color or RGB value)
- `intensity`: How strongly the color is applied (0.0 to 1.0)

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Green Tint">
    ![Green Tint](/images/skimage/effects/5_Green_Tint.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Invert Effect

Inverts the colors of the image, creating a negative-like effect.

```applescript
set {_effect} to invert effect with intensity 0.8
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

The `intensity` parameter controls how strongly the inversion is applied.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With Invert Effect">
    ![Invert Effect](/images/skimage/effects/10_Invert.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Pixelate Effect

Creates a blocky, pixelated appearance by reducing image detail.

```applescript
set {_effect} to pixelate effect with pixel size 8
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_effect}
```

The `pixel size` parameter determines the size of the "pixels" created. Larger values create a more pronounced pixelation effect.

<Tabs>

    ![Original](/images/skimage/effects/original.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With Pixelate Effect">
    ![Pixelate Effect](/images/skimage/effects/11_Pixelate.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Composite Effect

Combines multiple effects into a single operation, applied in sequence.

```applescript
set {_grayscale} to grayscale effect with intensity 0.7
set {_blur} to blur effect with radius 3
set {_composite} to composite effect with effects {_grayscale}, {_blur}
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_composite}
```

<Tabs>

    ![Original](/images/skimage/effects/original.png)
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="With Grayscale + Blur Effect">
    ![Composite Effect](/images/skimage/effects/12_Grayscale_Blur.png)
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of using image effects:

### Creating a Vintage Photo Effect

```applescript
# Load the image
set {_img} to image from file "path/to/image.jpg"

# Create the vintage effect
set {_sepia} to sepia effect with intensity 0.8
set {_vignette} to color tint effect with color black and intensity 0.2
set {_contrast} to contrast effect with factor 1.2

# Apply the effects
set {_img} to {_img} with effects {_sepia} and {_contrast} and {_vignette}

# Save the result
save image {_img} to "path/to/vintage_image.jpg"
```

### Creating a Dreamy, Soft Effect

```applescript
# Load the image
set {_img} to image from file "path/to/image.jpg"

# Create the dreamy effect
set {_brightness} to brightness effect with factor 1.1
set {_blur} to blur effect with radius 2
set {_tint} to color tint effect with color (color from rgb 150, 180, 255) and intensity 0.15

# Apply the effects
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_brightness}
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_blur}
set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_tint}

# Save the result
save image {_img} to "path/to/dreamy_image.jpg"
```

### Creating a High-Contrast Black and White Image

```applescript
# Load the image
set {_img} to image from file "path/to/image.jpg"

# Create the high-contrast B&W effect
set {_grayscale} to grayscale effect with intensity 1.0
set {_contrast} to contrast effect with factor 1.5

# Apply the effects (using await for performance)
await set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_grayscale}
await set {_img} to {_img} with effect {_contrast}

# Save the result
save image {_img} to "path/to/high_contrast_bw.jpg"
```

### Creating a "Glitch" Effect

```applescript
# Load the image
set {_img} to image from file "path/to/image.jpg"

# Create the glitch effect components
set {_pixelate} to pixelate effect with pixel size 3
set {_contrast} to contrast effect with factor 1.3
set {_invert} to invert effect with intensity 0.3

# Apply the effects
await set {_img} to {_img} with effects {_pixelate} and {_contrast} and {_invert}

# Save the result
save image {_img} to "path/to/glitch_image.jpg"
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Performance Management**:
   - Use `await` before effect operations for large images when DiSky is installed
   - Apply multiple effects at once using composite effects when possible
   - Consider downsizing large images before applying complex effects

2. **Effects Sequencing**:
   - The order of effects matters! Applying a blur after a color effect will give different results than doing it in reverse
   - Experiment with different sequences to achieve the desired look

3. **Intensity Control**:
   - For most effects, using subtle intensity values (0.3-0.7) often gives more pleasing results than extreme values
   - You can always apply the same effect multiple times to gradually build up the desired strength
