</Steps>

## Usage Examples

### Reading Console Logs

To read and forward console messages to Discord, you can use DiSky's console event system:

```applescript
# Monitor all console messages and send them to a Discord channel
on console message:
    # Get the log message
    set {_message} to event-string

    # Send to a specific Discord channel
    set {_channel} to text channel with id "YOUR_CHANNEL_ID" in bot "YOUR_BOT_NAME"
    send {_message} to {_channel}
```

### Filtering Important Messages

You can filter messages to only send specific types of logs (errors, warnings, etc.):

```applescript
# Only send error messages to Discord
on console message:
    set {_message} to event-string

    # Check if message contains error keywords
    if {_message} contains "ERROR" or "SEVERE" or "Exception":
        set {_channel} to text channel with id "YOUR_ERROR_CHANNEL_ID" in bot "YOUR_BOT_NAME"
        send "🚨 **Server Error:** %nl%%{_message}%" to {_channel}
```

### Sending Custom Debug Messages

Send custom log messages to your server console for debugging:

```applescript
# Discord command to send a debug message to console
discord command debug <text>:
    prefixes: !
    roles: Administrator
    trigger:
        # Send the message to console
        send "Debug from %mention tag of event-user%: %arg-1%" to console

        # Confirm to Discord
        reply with "Debug message sent to console!"
```

### Advanced Monitoring System

Create a comprehensive monitoring system with multiple channels:

```applescript
# Complete console monitoring system
on console message:
    set {_message} to event-string
    set {_bot} to bot named "YOUR_BOT_NAME"

    # Error channel
    if {_message} contains "ERROR" or "SEVERE" or "Exception":
        set {_channel} to text channel with id "ERROR_CHANNEL_ID" with {_bot}
        make embed:
            set title of embed to "❌ Server Error"
            set description of embed to {_message}
            set color of embed to red
        send last embed to {_channel}
        stop

    # Warning channel
    if {_message} contains "WARN" or "WARNING":
        set {_channel} to text channel with id "WARNING_CHANNEL_ID" with {_bot}
        make embed:
            set title of embed to "⚠️ Server Warning"
            set description of embed to {_message}
            set color of embed to orange
        send last embed to {_channel}
        stop

    # General logs channel
    set {_channel} to text channel with id "LOGS_CHANNEL_ID" with {_bot}
    send {_message} to {_channel}
```

## Use Cases

### Server Administration

Monitor your server health and catch issues before they become problems:

- Track player joins/leaves
- Monitor plugin errors
- Catch performance warnings
- Debug command issues

### Development & Testing

Use ConsoleLogs during development to streamline your workflow:

```applescript
# Send debug messages during development
set {_data} to some value
send "DEBUG: Variable value is %{_data}%" to console

# This appears in both server console and Discord
```

### Security & Auditing

Keep an audit trail of important server events:

```applescript
# Log important actions to console and Discord
on player command:
    if command contains "op" or "deop" or "gamemode":
        send "AUDIT: %player% executed: /%command%" to console
```

## Troubleshooting

<Aside type="note">
If you're not seeing console messages in Discord, check these common issues:
</Aside>

### Messages Not Appearing

- **Verify bot permissions**: Ensure your bot has permission to send messages in the target channel
- **Check channel IDs**: Double-check that you're using the correct Discord channel IDs
- **Confirm bot status**: Make sure your DiSky bot is online and connected

### Too Many Messages

If you're getting flooded with console messages:

```applescript
# Add rate limiting
on console message:
    # Only send every 5th message
    add 1 to {console.counter}
    if {console.counter} is greater than or equal to 5:
        set {console.counter} to 0
        # Send to Discord
        set {_channel} to text channel with id "CHANNEL_ID" in bot "BOT_NAME"
        send event-string to {_channel}
```

### Performance Concerns

<Aside type="caution">
Sending every console message to Discord can impact performance. Consider filtering messages or using batch sending for high-traffic servers.
</Aside>

## Best Practices

1. **Filter Messages**: Don't forward every console message—focus on important events
2. **Use Separate Channels**: Create different Discord channels for errors, warnings, and general logs
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting to prevent spam
4. **Format Messages**: Use embeds for better readability in Discord
5. **Security**: Never expose sensitive information from console logs in public Discord channels
