## Basic Usage

TranSkript provides one main effect that can be used in two different contexts:

### Generating from a Channel

Generate a transcript of the last 100 messages (Discord's maximum) from a channel:

```applescript
# Generate transcript from a channel
set {_channel} to event-channel  # can be any messaging channel, including DMs
generate transcript from channel {_channel} and store it in "plugins/transcripts/chat.html"
```

<Aside type="note">
The transcript will capture the most recent 100 messages from the channel. This is a Discord API limitation.
</Aside>

### Generating from Specific Messages

If you have a specific list of messages you want to include:

```applescript
# Generate transcript from specific messages
set {_messages::*} to ...  # your message list
generate transcript from messages {_messages::*} and store it in "plugins/transcripts/conversation.html"
```

## Customization Options

TranSkript uses Discord's default "airy" theme and dark mode by default. You can customize the appearance by enabling compact mode and/or light theme.

### Creating Custom Options

```applescript
# Compact mode only
set {_opts} to new transcript options with compact mode

# Light theme only
set {_opts} to new transcript options with light theme

# Both compact mode and light theme
set {_opts} to new transcript options with compact mode and light theme
```

### Applying Options

Use the options when generating transcripts:

```applescript
# Create custom options
set {_opts} to new transcript options with compact mode and light theme

# Generate transcript with custom options
generate transcript from channel {_channel} with {_opts} and store it in "plugins/transcripts/chat.html"
```

## Practical Examples

### Archiving Support Tickets

Create a transcript when a support ticket is closed:

```applescript
# When a ticket is closed
discord command close:
    prefixes: !
    trigger:
        # Check if this is a ticket channel
        if {ticket::%discord id of event-channel%} is not set:
            reply with "This is not a ticket channel!"
            stop

        # Generate transcript
        set {_opts} to new transcript options with light theme
        generate transcript from channel event-channel with {_opts} and store it in "plugins/transcripts/ticket-%discord id of event-channel%.html"

        # Send confirmation
        reply with "Ticket transcript saved! Closing channel in 5 seconds..."

        # Wait and close
        wait 5 seconds
        delete event-channel
```

### Logging Deleted Messages

Save transcripts of channels before deletion:

```applescript
# Before deleting a channel
on channel delete:
    # Generate a transcript for record-keeping
    generate transcript from channel event-channel and store it in "plugins/transcripts/deleted-%discord id of event-channel%-%now%.html"

    # Log the deletion
    send "Channel transcript saved before deletion" to console
```

### Creating Conversation Archives

Archive important conversations for future reference:

```applescript
discord command archive:
    prefixes: !
    roles: Moderator
    trigger:
        # Generate transcript
        set {_timestamp} to now
        set {_filename} to "plugins/transcripts/%discord id of event-channel%-%{_timestamp}%.html"

        generate transcript from channel event-channel and store it in {_filename}

        # Upload the transcript file
        reply with file {_filename} with message "Here's the conversation archive!"
```

### Exporting Specific Message Ranges

Export a custom range of messages:

```applescript
discord command export <integer> [<integer>]:
    prefixes: !
    trigger:
        # arg-1 is the number of messages or start ID
        # arg-2 (optional) is the end ID

        set {_limit} to arg-1
        if {_limit} is greater than 100:
            reply with "Can only export up to 100 messages at a time!"
            stop

        # Retrieve messages from the channel
        set {_messages::*} to last {_limit} messages from event-channel

        # Generate transcript
        set {_opts} to new transcript options with compact mode
        generate transcript from messages {_messages::*} with {_opts} and store it in "plugins/transcripts/export-%now%.html"

        reply with file "plugins/transcripts/export-%now%.html" with message "Export complete!"
```

## Advanced Features

### Combining with DiSky Events

Use TranSkript with DiSky's message events:

```applescript
# Archive conversations when specific keywords are mentioned
on message received:
    if message contains "!archive":
        # Check permissions
        if event-member has permission administrator:
            # Generate and upload transcript
            generate transcript from channel event-channel and store it in "plugins/temp/archive.html"
            send file "plugins/temp/archive.html" to event-channel
```

### Scheduled Archives

Create automatic daily archives:

```applescript
# Daily archive at midnight
every day at 00:00:
    loop all text channels tagged with "archive":
        set {_channel} to loop-value
        set {_date} to now
        set {_filename} to "plugins/archives/%discord id of {_channel}%-%{_date}%.html"

        generate transcript from channel {_channel} and store it in {_filename}
```

## Theme Comparison

### Dark Mode (Default)

The default dark theme matches Discord's dark mode appearance, providing a familiar experience for users who prefer dark themes.

```applescript
# Default dark theme
generate transcript from channel {_channel} and store it in "dark-theme.html"
```

### Light Mode

Enable light theme for a brighter appearance:

```applescript
# Light theme
set {_opts} to new transcript options with light theme
generate transcript from channel {_channel} with {_opts} and store it in "light-theme.html"
```

### Compact Mode

Compact mode reduces spacing for a more condensed view:

```applescript
# Compact mode
set {_opts} to new transcript options with compact mode
generate transcript from channel {_channel} with {_opts} and store it in "compact.html"
```

## File Management

### Organizing Transcripts

Create an organized folder structure:

```applescript
# Organize by date and channel
set {_date} to now formatted as "yyyy-MM-dd"
set {_channel-name} to name of event-channel
set {_folder} to "plugins/transcripts/%{_date}%/"

# Ensure folder exists
create directories {_folder}

# Generate transcript with organized path
set {_file} to "%{_folder}%%{_channel-name}%.html"
generate transcript from channel event-channel and store it in {_file}
```

### Cleaning Old Transcripts

Implement automatic cleanup of old transcripts:

```applescript
# Clean transcripts older than 30 days
every day at 03:00:
    loop files in "plugins/transcripts/":
        if modification date of loop-file was more than 30 days ago:
            delete loop-file
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

<Aside type="note">
If transcripts aren't generating correctly, check these common issues:
</Aside>

**Java Version**
- TranSkript requires Java 16 or higher
- Check your Java version with `/version` in console

**DiSky Version**
- Ensure you're running DiSky v4.21.0 or higher
- Update DiSky if necessary

**File Permissions**
- Verify that your server has write permissions to the target directory
- Check that the plugins/transcripts folder exists

**Missing Messages**
- Remember that only the last 100 messages can be retrieved from a channel
- For specific ranges, store messages as they arrive

### File Not Found Errors

Ensure the target directory exists:

```applescript
# Create directory before saving
on load:
    create directories "plugins/transcripts/"
```

### Large Transcripts

For channels with many embeds or attachments:

<Aside type="caution">
Transcripts with many images or embeds can become very large. Consider generating transcripts for smaller message ranges or compressing the HTML files.
</Aside>

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Archives**: Archive important channels regularly to maintain conversation history
2. **Storage Management**: Implement cleanup routines to prevent excessive disk usage
3. **Permissions**: Only allow trusted users to generate transcripts
4. **File Naming**: Use descriptive, timestamped filenames for easy organization
5. **Theme Selection**: Choose themes that match your users' preferences or your brand

## Performance Considerations

### Message Limits

```applescript
# For performance, limit the number of messages
if arg-1 is greater than 50:
    reply with "Please request fewer than 50 messages for optimal performance."
    stop

set {_messages::*} to last arg-1 messages from event-channel
generate transcript from messages {_messages::*} and store it in "transcript.html"
```

### Asynchronous Generation

Consider offloading transcript generation:

```applescript
# Inform user that generation may take time
reply with "Generating transcript... This may take a moment."

# Generate transcript
generate transcript from channel event-channel and store it in {_file}

# Notify completion
send file {_file} to event-user with message "Transcript ready!"
```
