## Best Practices

1. **Unique IDs** - Always use unique IDs for buttons and dropdowns
2. **Meaningful names** - Use descriptive IDs like `confirm_delete` not `btn1`
3. **Always respond** - Reply or defer within 3 seconds
4. **Disable when done** - Disable buttons after they're used
5. **Clear placeholders** - Use descriptive placeholder text for dropdowns
6. **Limit choices** - Don't overwhelm users with too many options
7. **Visual feedback** - Use emojis and colors to guide users
8. **Error handling** - Check if roles/channels exist before using them

  Test your components thoroughly! Make sure they work on both desktop and mobile Discord clients.

## Common Pitfalls

### Forgetting to Reply

```applescript
# ❌ Bad - no response
on button click:
    send "User clicked" to console

# ✅ Good - always reply
on button click:
    reply with "Button clicked!"
```

### Not Checking IDs

```applescript
# ❌ Bad - handles all buttons
on button click:
    delete event-member

# ✅ Good - check specific button
on button click:
    if event-string is "confirm_delete":
        delete event-member
```

### Hardcoded Values

```applescript
# ❌ Bad - hardcoded page number
add new button with id "page_2" named "Next"

# ✅ Good - dynamic values
add new button with id "page_%{_currentPage} + 1%" named "Next"
```

- Explore [Modals](/guides/interactions/modals/) for text input
- Read the [Components Guide](/guides/interactions/components/) for detailed information
- Check [Basic Examples](/examples/basic/) for more code samples
