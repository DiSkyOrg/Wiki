DiSky makes it easy to send messages to Discord channels. This guide covers simple text messages and embeds.

## Sending Text Messages

The simplest way to send a message is using the `post` or `reply` effects.

### Replying to Events

Use `reply with` inside DiSky events (like slash commands or message events):

```applescript
on message receive:
    reply with "Hello there!"
```

### Posting to Channels

Use `post` to send messages to specific channels:

```applescript
# Post to a specific channel
post "Hello World!" to text channel with id "123456789"

# Post to a channel variable
post "Hello!" to {_channel}
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Use `reply with` whenever possible in events - it's simpler and automatically targets the correct channel.
</Aside>

## Creating Embeds

Embeds are rich messages with colors, images, fields, and more. They make your bot's messages look professional and organized.

### Embed Components

An embed can have:

- **Title** (with optional URL)
- **Description** (main text content)
- **Author** (with optional icon and URL)
- **Color** (left border color)
- **Fields** (inline or full-width)
- **Footer** (with optional icon)
- **Thumbnail** (small image in top-right)
- **Image** (large image)
- **Timestamp**

### Basic Embed Example

```applescript
make embed and store it in {_embed}:
    set title of embed to "Welcome!"
    set description of embed to "Thanks for joining our server"
    set embed color of embed to blue
    set footer of embed to "DiSky Bot"

reply with {_embed}
```

### Complete Embed Example

Here's an embed using all available properties:

```applescript
make embed and store it in {_embed}:
    # Title (clickable if URL is provided)
    set title of embed to "Embed Title"
    set title url of embed to "https://example.com"

    # Main content
    set description of embed to "This is the embed description%nl%It supports multiple lines!"

    # Author section
    set author of embed to "Author Name"
    set author icon of embed to "https://example.com/icon.png"
    set author url of embed to "https://example.com"

    # Color (left border)
    set embed color of embed to orange

    # Fields (can be inline or not)
    add inline field named "Field 1" with value "Inline field" to fields of embed
    add inline field named "Field 2" with value "Another inline" to fields of embed
    add inline field named "Field 3" with value "Third inline" to fields of embed
    add field named "Full Width" with value "This field spans the full width" to fields of embed

    # Footer
    set footer of embed to "Footer Text"
    set footer icon of embed to "https://example.com/footer-icon.png"

    # Images
    set thumbnail of embed to "https://example.com/thumbnail.png"
    set image of embed to "https://example.com/image.png"

    # Timestamp (shows "Today at XX:XX")
    set timestamp of embed to now

reply with {_embed}
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Sub-Properties Requirement">
  You cannot set sub-properties (like author icon) without setting the main property (author) first.
</Aside>

### Field Layouts

Fields can be inline (up to 3 per row) or full-width:

```applescript
make embed:
    # Inline fields (up to 3 per row)
    add inline field named "CPU" with value "45%%" to fields of embed
    add inline field named "RAM" with value "2.1 GB" to fields of embed
    add inline field named "Disk" with value "67%%" to fields of embed

    # Full-width field
    add field named "Status" with value "All systems operational" to fields of embed
```

<Aside type="tip">
  When an image is included, only 2 inline fields can fit per row instead of 3.
</Aside>

## Color Options

You can set embed colors in several ways:

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Named Colors">

```applescript
set embed color of embed to orange
set embed color of embed to blue
set embed color of embed to red
set embed color of embed to green
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Hex Colors">

```applescript
set embed color of embed to hex "#FF5733"
set embed color of embed to hex "#00FF00"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="RGB Colors">

```applescript
set embed color of embed to rgb(255, 87, 51)
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Embed Templates (v4.26.0+)

Reuse embeds across your bot by registering templates:

### Registering a Template

```applescript
# Define once (e.g., on script load)
register embed "welcome":
    set title of embed to "Welcome!"
    set embed color of embed to blue
    set description of embed to "Thanks for joining our server!"
    set footer of embed to "We hope you enjoy your stay"
```

### Using a Template

```applescript
# Use anywhere
reply with embed template "welcome"
post embed template "welcome" to {_channel}
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Use Templates?">
  Templates are perfect for frequently used embeds like welcome messages, error messages, or help embeds. Define once, use everywhere!
</Aside>

## Practical Examples

### Server Statistics Embed

```applescript
command /stats:
    trigger:
        make embed and store it in {_embed}:
            set title of embed to "Server Statistics"
            set embed color of embed to green
            add inline field named "Members" with value "%size of all members%" to fields of embed
            add inline field named "Online" with value "%size of online members%" to fields of embed
            add inline field named "Channels" with value "%size of all channels%" to fields of embed
            set footer of embed to "Last updated"
            set timestamp of embed to now

        reply with {_embed}
```

### User Profile Embed

```applescript
on message receive:
    if message is "/profile":
        make embed:
            set title of embed to "User Profile"
            set author of embed to discord name of event-user
            set author icon of embed to avatar of event-user
            set embed color of embed to blue
            add field named "User ID" with value id of event-user to fields of embed
            add field named "Account Created" with value "%creation date of event-user%" to fields of embed
            set thumbnail of embed to avatar of event-user

        reply with last embed
```

### Error Message Template

```applescript
# Register error template
register embed "error":
    set title of embed to "❌ Error"
    set embed color of embed to red
    set footer of embed to "If this persists, contact support"

# Use in commands
on slash command:
    if event-user doesn't have permission "admin":
        # You can modify templates when using them
        make embed based on embed template "error":
            set description of embed to "You don't have permission to use this command."
        reply with last embed
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use embeds for rich content** - They're more visually appealing than plain text
2. **Keep titles short** - Long titles get truncated
3. **Use colors meaningfully** - Green for success, red for errors, blue for info
4. **Don't overuse fields** - Too many fields make embeds cluttered
5. **Add timestamps for time-sensitive info** - Shows when the embed was created
6. **Use templates for repeated embeds** - Saves time and ensures consistency

## Limitations

- Text messages: 2000 characters max
- Embed title: 256 characters max
- Embed description: 4096 characters max
- Embed fields: 25 fields max
- Field name: 256 characters max
- Field value: 1024 characters max
- Footer text: 2048 characters max
- Author name: 256 characters max
- **Total embed size: 6000 characters max** (all text combined)

<Aside type="caution">
  Bots can only send **one embed per message**. Webhooks can send up to 5 embeds per message.
