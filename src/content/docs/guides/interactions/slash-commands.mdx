title: Slash Commands
description: Create modern Discord slash commands with arguments and auto-complete
---

import { Aside, Steps, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

Slash commands are Discord's modern, native command system. They provide auto-complete, built-in argument validation, and a clean interface that's discoverable by users. No more remembering prefixes or command syntax!

## What Are Slash Commands?

Slash commands appear in Discord's command picker when users type `/`. They offer:

- **Auto-discovery** - Users can see all available commands
- **Type validation** - Discord enforces argument types
- **Better UX** - Clean interface with descriptions and hints
- **No prefix confusion** - Always start with `/`

## Command Structure

Slash commands can have three levels of organization:

1. **Root Command** - The base command (e.g., `/level`)
2. **Command Group** - Optional grouping (e.g., `/admin settings`)
3. **Subcommand** - Commands within a group (e.g., `/admin settings view`)

### Simple Command Example

```
/level user:@John
```

- Root command: `level`
- Argument: `user` (type: User)

### Grouped Command Example

```
/snippets search query:example
```

- Root command: `snippets`
- Subcommand: `search`
- Argument: `query` (type: String)

## Creating a Basic Slash Command

Define slash commands in your bot's `on ready` section:

### Simple Command

```applescript
define bot XXX:
    on ready:
        # Create command
        set {_cmd} to new slash command named "ping" with description "Check the bot's latency"

        # Register globally
        update {_cmd} globally in event-bot
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Why on ready?">
  Register slash commands in `on ready` so they're only created once when the bot starts, not every time the script reloads.
</Aside>

### Handling the Command

```applescript
on slash command:
    if event-string is "ping":
        reply with "Pong! 🏓"
```

The `event-string` contains the command name, so you can handle multiple commands in one event.

## Adding Arguments (Options)

Arguments (called "options" in Discord) let users provide input to commands:

### Command with Argument

```applescript
on ready:
    # Create command
    set {_level} to new slash command named "level" with description "Check a user's level"

    # Add user option (optional)
    add new user option named "target" with description "The user to check" to options of {_level}

    # Register
    update {_level} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "level":
        # Get the argument (might be null)
        set {_target} to argument "target" as user

        # Use fallback if not provided
        if {_target} is not set:
            set {_target} to event-user

        reply with "%mention tag of {_target}% is level 42"
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Optional arguments can be `null`. Always provide a fallback value or check if they're set.
</Aside>

### Required Arguments

Make arguments mandatory:

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "ban" with description "Ban a user"

    # Add required user argument
    set {_option} to new user option named "user" with description "User to ban"
    set required state of {_option} to true
    add {_option} to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "ban":
        set {_user} to argument "user" as user
        # {_user} is guaranteed to be set (required)
        reply with "Banned %mention tag of {_user}%"
```

## Option Types

Discord supports various argument types:

| Type | Description | Supports Choices |
|------|-------------|------------------|
| `STRING` | Plain text | ✅ Yes |
| `INTEGER` | Whole numbers | ✅ Yes |
| `NUMBER` | Decimal numbers | ✅ Yes |
| `BOOLEAN` | True/False | ❌ No |
| `USER` | Discord user | ❌ No |
| `CHANNEL` | Guild channel | ❌ No |
| `ROLE` | Server role | ❌ No |
| `ATTACHMENT` | File upload | ❌ No |

### Creating Different Option Types

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="String">

```applescript
add new string option named "text" with description "Enter some text" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value
on slash command:
    set {_text} to argument "text" as string
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Integer">

```applescript
add new integer option named "amount" with description "Enter a number" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value
on slash command:
    set {_amount} to argument "amount" as integer
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Number">

```applescript
add new number option named "price" with description "Enter a price" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value
on slash command:
    set {_price} to argument "price" as number
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Boolean">

```applescript
add new boolean option named "enabled" with description "Enable or disable" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value
on slash command:
    set {_enabled} to argument "enabled" as boolean
    if {_enabled} is true:
        reply with "Enabled!"
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="User">

```applescript
add new user option named "target" with description "Select a user" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value
on slash command:
    set {_user} to argument "target" as user
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Channel">

```applescript
add new channel option named "destination" with description "Select a channel" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value
on slash command:
    set {_channel} to argument "destination" as channel
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Role">

```applescript
add new role option named "role" with description "Select a role" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value
on slash command:
    set {_role} to argument "role" as role
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Attachment">

```applescript
add new attachment option named "file" with description "Upload a file" to options of {_cmd}

# Get value and use it
on slash command:
    set {_file} to argument "file" as attachment

    # Check if it's an image
    if attachment {_file} is an image:
        download {_file} to path "uploads/%file name of {_file}%"
        reply with "Image saved: %file name of {_file}%"
    else:
        reply with "Please upload an image!"
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Choices (Predefined Values)

For STRING, INTEGER, and NUMBER options, you can provide predefined choices:

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "gamemode" with description "Change your gamemode"

    # Create option with choices
    set {_option} to new string option named "mode" with description "Select gamemode"

    # Add choices
    add new choice named "Survival" with value "survival" to choices of {_option}
    add new choice named "Creative" with value "creative" to choices of {_option}
    add new choice named "Adventure" with value "adventure" to choices of {_option}
    add new choice named "Spectator" with value "spectator" to choices of {_option}

    set required state of {_option} to true
    add {_option} to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "gamemode":
        set {_mode} to argument "mode" as string

        # {_mode} is guaranteed to be one of the choice values
        reply with "Gamemode set to: %{_mode}%"
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Choices create a dropdown menu in Discord. The user can only select from the provided options, ensuring valid input.
</Aside>

## Localizations

Since DiSky v4.3.0, you can provide translations for different languages:

```applescript
on ready:
    # Create command with default English name/description
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "level" with description "Check your level"

    # Add French localization
    add new locale data for "FR" with value "niveau" to name localizations of {_cmd}
    add new locale data for "FR" with value "Voir votre niveau" to description localizations of {_cmd}

    # Add Spanish localization
    add new locale data for "ES" with value "nivel" to name localizations of {_cmd}
    add new locale data for "ES" with value "Ver tu nivel" to description localizations of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot
```

Users see the command in their Discord language if you've provided a localization.

Find locale codes in the [Discord documentation](https://discord.com/developers/docs/reference#locales).

## Command Registration Scopes

You can register commands globally or per-guild:

### Global Commands

```applescript
# Register for all servers (takes up to 1 hour to update)
update {_cmd} globally in event-bot
```

Global commands:
- Available in all servers
- Take up to 1 hour to update
- Good for stable, production commands

### Guild Commands

```applescript
# Register for specific guild (instant update)
update {_cmd} in event-guild with event-bot
```

Guild commands:
- Only available in that server
- Update instantly
- Good for testing and server-specific commands

<Aside type="tip" title="Development Tip">
  Use guild commands during development for instant updates, then switch to global commands for production.
</Aside>

## Practical Examples

### User Info Command

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "userinfo" with description "Get information about a user"

    add new user option named "target" with description "User to check (defaults to you)" to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "userinfo":
        set {_target} to argument "target" as user
        if {_target} is not set:
            set {_target} to event-user

        make embed:
            set title of embed to "User Information"
            set author of embed to discord name of {_target}
            set author icon of embed to avatar of {_target}
            set embed color of embed to blue

            add field named "ID" with value discord id of {_target} to fields of embed
            add field named "Created" with value "%creation date of {_target}%" to fields of embed

            set thumbnail of embed to avatar of {_target}

        reply with last embed
```

### Math Command with Choices

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "math" with description "Perform math operations"

    # Operation choice
    set {_op} to new string option named "operation" with description "Select operation"
    add new choice named "Add" with value "add" to choices of {_op}
    add new choice named "Subtract" with value "sub" to choices of {_op}
    add new choice named "Multiply" with value "mul" to choices of {_op}
    add new choice named "Divide" with value "div" to choices of {_op}
    set required state of {_op} to true
    add {_op} to options of {_cmd}

    # Numbers
    set {_num1} to new number option named "first" with description "First number"
    set required state of {_num1} to true
    add {_num1} to options of {_cmd}

    set {_num2} to new number option named "second" with description "Second number"
    set required state of {_num2} to true
    add {_num2} to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "math":
        set {_op} to argument "operation" as string
        set {_a} to argument "first" as number
        set {_b} to argument "second" as number

        if {_op} is "add":
            set {_result} to {_a} + {_b}
        else if {_op} is "sub":
            set {_result} to {_a} - {_b}
        else if {_op} is "mul":
            set {_result} to {_a} * {_b}
        else if {_op} is "div":
            if {_b} is 0:
                reply with "❌ Cannot divide by zero!"
                stop
            set {_result} to {_a} / {_b}

        reply with "**Result:** %{_result}%"
```

### Moderation Command with Permissions

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "kick" with description "Kick a user from the server"

    set {_user} to new user option named "user" with description "User to kick"
    set required state of {_user} to true
    add {_user} to options of {_cmd}

    add new string option named "reason" with description "Reason for kick" to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "kick":
        # Check permissions
        if event-user doesn't have permission "KICK_MEMBERS":
            reply with hidden "❌ You don't have permission to kick members!"
            stop

        set {_target} to argument "user" as user
        set {_reason} to argument "reason" as string
        if {_reason} is not set:
            set {_reason} to "No reason provided"

        # Perform kick
        kick {_target} from event-guild due to {_reason}

        reply with "✅ Kicked %mention tag of {_target}% - Reason: %{_reason}%"
```

### File Upload Handler

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "upload" with description "Upload a file"

    set {_file} to new attachment option named "file" with description "File to upload"
    set required state of {_file} to true
    add {_file} to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "upload":
        set {_file} to argument "file" as attachment

        # Check size (8MB limit for most servers)
        if size of {_file} > 8388608:  # 8MB in bytes
            reply with hidden "❌ File too large! Maximum size is 8MB."
            stop

        # Check type
        if attachment {_file} is an image:
            download {_file} to path "uploads/images/%file name of {_file}%"
            reply with "✅ Image saved: %file name of {_file}%"
        else:
            reply with "❌ Please upload an image file!"
```

### Admin Command Group

```applescript
on ready:
    # Root command
    set {_admin} to new slash command named "admin" with description "Administration commands"

    # Create subcommand group
    set {_group} to new command group named "settings" with description "Server settings"

    # Subcommand within group
    set {_sub} to new subcommand named "view" with description "View current settings"
    add {_sub} to subcommands of {_group}

    # Add group to root command
    add {_group} to groups of {_admin}

    update {_admin} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "admin":
        # Handle subcommand
        reply with "Admin settings viewed!"
```

## Best Practices

<Steps>

1. **Clear Descriptions**

   Write helpful descriptions for commands and options. Users rely on these!

2. **Use Appropriate Types**

   Choose the right option type - don't use STRING for numbers or users.

3. **Provide Defaults**

   For optional arguments, have sensible fallback values.

4. **Validate Input**

   Even with type checking, validate ranges, permissions, etc.

5. **Use Choices When Appropriate**

   If there are only a few valid values, use choices instead of free text.

6. **Handle Edge Cases**

   Check for null values, zero division, invalid permissions, etc.

7. **Give Feedback**

   Always reply to slash commands - users need confirmation.

</Steps>

## Argument Naming Best Practices

### Using Hyphens in Argument Names

Since DiSky v4.27, you can use hyphens (`-`) in argument names for improved readability:

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "settings" with description "Manage settings"

    # ✅ Good: Using hyphens for multi-word arguments (v4.27+)
    add new boolean option named "auto-delete" with description "Enable auto-delete" to options of {_cmd}
    add new integer option named "max-count" with description "Maximum count" to options of {_cmd}
    add new string option named "user-name" with description "User name" to options of {_cmd}

    # Also valid: Using underscores or camelCase
    add new boolean option named "auto_delete" with description "Enable auto-delete" to options of {_cmd}
    add new integer option named "maxCount" with description "Maximum count" to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot

on slash command:
    if event-string is "settings":
        # Access arguments using the same name
        set {_autoDelete} to argument "auto-delete" as boolean
        set {_maxCount} to argument "max-count" as integer
        set {_userName} to argument "user-name" as string

        reply with "Settings updated!"
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Readability First">
  Hyphens often make argument names more readable than underscores or camelCase, especially for users who see them in Discord's interface. Choose the style that works best for your bot's consistency.
</Aside>

**Example - Consistent Naming:**

```applescript
on ready:
    set {_cmd} to new slash command named "user-profile" with description "View user profile"

    set {_userOpt} to new user option named "target-user" with description "User to check"
    add {_userOpt} to options of {_cmd}

    set {_showOpt} to new boolean option named "show-badges" with description "Display badges"
    add {_showOpt} to options of {_cmd}

    set {_includeOpt} to new boolean option named "include-stats" with description "Include statistics"
    add {_includeOpt} to options of {_cmd}

    update {_cmd} globally in event-bot
```

## Command Limits

- **Command name**: 1-32 characters, alphanumeric and hyphens only
- **Description**: 1-100 characters
- **Options per command**: 25 maximum
- **Option names**: 1-32 characters, alphanumeric, hyphens, and underscores (hyphens supported since v4.27)
- **Choices per option**: 25 maximum
- **Subcommands per group**: 25 maximum
- **Groups per command**: 25 maximum

## Troubleshooting

### Command Not Appearing

**Problem:** Slash command doesn't show up in Discord.

**Solutions:**
- Wait up to 1 hour for global commands
- Use guild commands for instant testing
- Verify bot has `applications.commands` scope
- Check console for registration errors

### Arguments Not Working

**Problem:** Can't get argument values.

**Solutions:**
- Verify argument name matches exactly
- Check you're using correct type (as user, as string, etc.)
- Ensure optional arguments are checked for null
- Make required arguments truly required

### Permission Errors

**Problem:** Users can use commands they shouldn't.

**Solutions:**
- Check permissions in your event handler
- Use Discord's built-in permission system
- Provide clear error messages for denied access
- Log permission violations

### "This interaction failed"

**Problem:** Discord shows error message.

**Solutions:**
- Reply within 3 seconds
- Use `defer` if processing takes time
- Check for errors in your handler
- Ensure event handler is running
