The welcome screen is the first thing new members see when joining your server. It displays a custom message and highlights important channels, helping newcomers navigate your community.

<Aside type="note" title="Available since v4.10.0">
  Welcome screen modification features were introduced in DiSky v4.10.0.
</Aside>

## What Is a Welcome Screen?

The welcome screen appears when users join your server and shows:

- **Server description** - A brief overview of your community
- **Recommended channels** - Up to 5 important channels with descriptions and emojis
- **Visual guidance** - Helps new members know where to start

<Aside type="caution" title="Server Requirements">
  Your server must have the **Community** feature enabled to use welcome screens. Enable it in Server Settings > Enable Community.
</Aside>

## Welcome Screen Structure

A welcome screen consists of:

1. **Description** - Text explaining what your server is about
2. **Channel List** - Up to 5 channels with:
   - Channel reference
   - Custom label/name
   - Optional emoji
   - Brief description

## Modifying the Welcome Screen

Use the `modify welcome screen` section to update your server's welcome screen:

### Basic Example

```applescript
command /setupwelcome:
    trigger:
        set {_guild} to event-guild

        modify welcome screen of {_guild}:
            # Set the server description
            change the screen description to "Welcome to our community! Please read the rules and get roles before chatting."

            # Add recommended channels (up to 5)
            add channel with id "RULES_CHANNEL_ID" named "Read our rules" with reaction "📜" to the screen
            add channel with id "ROLES_CHANNEL_ID" named "Get roles" with reaction "🎟️" to the screen

        reply with "✅ Welcome screen updated!"
```

### Complete Welcome Screen Setup

```applescript
command /updatewelcome:
    trigger:
        set {_guild} to event-guild

        modify welcome screen of {_guild}:
            # Server description
            change the screen description to "🎮 Welcome to Gaming Hub!%nl%Join our community of gamers, make friends, and have fun!"

            # Essential channels
            add channel with id "RULES_ID" named "📋 Rules & Guidelines" with reaction "📜" to the screen
            add channel with id "ROLES_ID" named "🎭 Get Your Roles" with reaction "🎟️" to the screen
            add channel with id "CHAT_ID" named "💬 General Chat" with reaction "💬" to the screen

            add channel with id "HELP_ID" named "❓ Need Help?" with reaction "❓" to the screen

        reply with hidden "✅ Welcome screen has been updated!"
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Changes apply immediately after the section executes. There's no need for a separate "save" command.
</Aside>

## Partial Updates

You can update only the description or only the channels:

### Update Description Only

```applescript
modify welcome screen of {_guild}:
    change the screen description to "New description text"
    # Channels remain unchanged
```

### Update Channels Only

```applescript
modify welcome screen of {_guild}:
    # Description remains unchanged

    # Replace all channels with new ones
    add channel with id "CHANNEL1" named "Channel 1" with reaction "1️⃣" to the screen
    add channel with id "CHANNEL2" named "Channel 2" with reaction "2️⃣" to the screen
```

<Aside type="caution">
  When adding channels, you replace ALL existing channels. Make sure to add all channels you want displayed.

## Best Practices

<Steps>

1. **Keep Description Concise**

   Make it brief but informative. New members should understand your server at a glance.

2. **Prioritize Essential Channels**

   Show rules, role selection, and main chat first. Save niche channels for later discovery.

3. **Use Clear Labels**

   Channel names should clearly indicate their purpose (e.g., "Get Roles Here" not just "Roles").

4. **Add Relevant Emojis**

   Emojis make the welcome screen more visual and help channels stand out.

5. **Update Regularly**

   Refresh the welcome screen for events, seasons, or when your server evolves.

6. **Test the Experience**

   Create a test account and join your server to see how the welcome screen looks.

7. **Don't Overwhelm**

   Limit to 3-5 channels. Too many options can confuse new members.

</Steps>

## Welcome Screen Guidelines

Tips for writing effective descriptions:

```applescript
# ✅ Good - Clear and welcoming
"Welcome to Art Hub! Share your creations, get feedback, and improve your skills. Start by reading the rules and introducing yourself!"

# ❌ Bad - Too vague
"Welcome. This is a server."

# ✅ Good - Specific benefits
"🎵 Music Producers Unite!%nl%✨ Share tracks%nl%🎓 Learn production%nl%🤝 Collaborate"

# ❌ Bad - Too long
"Welcome to our server! We have many channels for many different topics and we hope you enjoy your stay here. Please read all the rules before posting anything anywhere..."
```

## Troubleshooting

### Changes Not Applying

**Problem:** Welcome screen doesn't update.

**Solutions:**
- Verify server has Community feature enabled
- Check bot has `MANAGE_GUILD` permission
- Ensure channel IDs are valid
- Try viewing the welcome screen from a different account

### Community Feature Required Error

**Problem:** Error about community features.

**Solution:** Enable Community in Server Settings:
1. Go to Server Settings > Enable Community
2. Complete the setup process
3. Try updating the welcome screen again

### Invalid Channel IDs

**Problem:** Channels don't appear or cause errors.

**Solutions:**
- Double-check channel IDs are correct
- Verify channels exist and aren't deleted
- Ensure bot can see the channels
- Check you're using text channel IDs, not voice channels

### Too Many Channels

**Problem:** Can't add more than 5 channels.

**Explanation:** Discord limits welcome screens to 5 channels maximum.

**Solution:** Choose your 5 most important channels. Use the description to mention other key areas.

### Description Not Formatting

**Problem:** Line breaks or formatting don't work.

**Solutions:**
- Use `%nl%` for line breaks, not `\n`
- Test formatting before deploying
- Keep formatting simple (Discord's welcome screen has limited Markdown support)

## Welcome Screen Limits

- **Description**: 1-140 characters
- **Channels**: 5 maximum
- **Channel label**: 1-50 characters
- **Community feature**: Required
- **Permission needed**: `MANAGE_GUILD`

## Integration Ideas

### Welcome Screen + Verification

```applescript
# After user verifies, update them
on member verify:
    # Get unverified welcome channel
    set {_welcomeChan} to text channel with id "WELCOME_ID"

    post "Welcome %mention tag of event-member%! Check out the welcome screen to get started!" to {_welcomeChan}
```

### Scheduled Updates

```applescript
# Update welcome screen daily
every 1 day:
    loop all guilds:
        modify welcome screen of loop-value:
            change the screen description to "Welcome! Today is %now%. We have %size of members of loop-value% members!"
            # ... add channels ...
```

### Welcome Screen Command

Let moderators quickly update the welcome screen:

```applescript
command /quickwelcome <text>:
    trigger:
        # Check permissions
        if event-user doesn't have permission "MANAGE_GUILD":
            reply with hidden "❌ You need Manage Server permission!"
            stop

        modify welcome screen of event-guild:
            change the screen description to arg-1

        reply with "✅ Welcome description updated!"
```
