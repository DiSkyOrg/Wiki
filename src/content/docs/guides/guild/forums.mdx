Forum channels are Discord's organized discussion system, perfect for Q&A, announcements, or any topic-based community. Unlike regular text channels, forums organize conversations into individual posts (threads) that can be tagged, searched, and managed independently.

## What Are Forum Channels?

Forum channels are a special channel type that:

- Organize content into individual **posts** (threads)
- Use **tags** to categorize posts
- Display posts in a feed-like interface
- Support sorting and filtering

Think of them like Reddit or a traditional forum, but integrated into Discord.

<Aside type="note">
  Forum channels don't allow direct messages. All communication happens within posts (threads).
</Aside>

## Working with Forum Channels

### Getting a Forum Channel

```applescript
# By ID
set {_forum} to forum with id "123456789"

# From event
on message received:
    set {_forum} to event-channel
    if {_forum} is a forum channel:
        # Do something with forum
```

<Aside type="tip" title="Discord Commands">
  The `forum` type can be used in Discord command arguments too!

  ```applescript
  discord command info <forum>:
      trigger:
          reply with "Forum: %arg-1%"
  ```
</Aside>

### Getting Posts (Threads)

All posts in a forum are actually threads:

```applescript
# Get all threads/posts from a forum
set {_posts::*} to threads of forum with id "123456789"

# Loop through posts
loop {_posts::*}:
    set {_post} to loop-value
    set {_name} to discord name of {_post}
    broadcast "Post: %{_name}%"
```

## Forum Posts

Posts are represented as thread channels with additional properties.

### Post Properties

```applescript
set {_post} to ... # Get post/thread

# Get post name
set {_name} to discord name of {_post}

# Get the creator of the post (since v4.27)
set {_owner} to thread owner of {_post}
set {_owner} to owner of {_post}

# Get message count (since v4.27)
set {_count} to message count of {_post}
set {_count} to thread message count of {_post}

# Get members participating in the post
set {_members::*} to members of {_post}

# Get messages in the post
retrieve messages from {_post} and store them in {_messages::*}

# Get tags on the post
set {_tags::*} to tags of {_post}
```

<Aside type="tip" title="New in v4.27">
  You can now get the thread owner and message count directly! This is especially useful for displaying forum post statistics. See the [v4.27 Migration Guide](/migration/v4-27/) for more details.
</Aside>

### Creating Posts

```applescript
# Create a new post in a forum
create thread named "How do I...?" in forum with id "123456789" and store it in {_post}

# Send initial message to the post
post "Here's my question..." to {_post}
```

## Forum Tags

Tags help organize and categorize posts. Each forum has its own set of tags that can be applied to posts.

### Getting Tags

Tags must be retrieved from their parent forum channel:

```applescript
# Get a tag by name from a specific forum
set {_tag} to tag named "resolved" from forum channel with id "123456789"

# Check if tag exists
if {_tag} is set:
    # Tag found
else:
    # Tag doesn't exist
```

<Aside type="caution">
  Since each forum has its own tags, you must specify which forum you're getting the tag from. Tags from one forum can't be used in another.
</Aside>

### Creating Tags

Tags must be created and added to the forum before they can be used on posts:

```applescript
# Create a new tag (not yet on Discord)
set {_newTag} to new tag named "question" with reaction "❓"

# Add tag to the forum (now it exists on Discord)
add {_newTag} to tags of forum channel with id "123456789"
```

<Aside type="tip">
  Tags are created locally first, then added to the forum. They're not available until added to Discord.
</Aside>

### Adding Tags to Posts

Once a tag exists on the forum, you can add it to posts:

```applescript
# Get the tag from the forum
set {_tag} to tag named "solved" from forum channel with id "FORUM_ID"

# Add tag to a post
add {_tag} to tags of thread channel with id "POST_ID"
```

### Tag Properties

```applescript
set {_tag} to new tag named "bug" with reaction "🐛"

# Tags have:
# - Name: displayed text
# - Emoji: optional visual indicator
```

## Practical Examples

### Q&A Forum System

```applescript
command /createforum:
    trigger:
        # Create forum channel
        await create new forum channel named "Questions & Answers" in event-guild and store it in {_forum}

        # Create useful tags
        set {_questionTag} to new tag named "question" with reaction "❓"
        set {_solvedTag} to new tag named "solved" with reaction "✅"
        set {_bugTag} to new tag named "bug" with reaction "🐛"
        set {_featureTag} to new tag named "feature-request" with reaction "💡"

        # Add tags to forum
        add {_questionTag} to tags of {_forum}
        add {_solvedTag} to tags of {_forum}
        add {_bugTag} to tags of {_forum}
        add {_featureTag} to tags of {_forum}

        reply with "✅ Q&A forum created with tags!"
```

### Mark Post as Solved

```applescript
command /solved:
    trigger:
        # Get current channel (must be a forum post)
        set {_post} to event-channel

        # Verify it's a thread in a forum
        if {_post} is not a thread channel:
            reply with "❌ This command only works in forum posts!"
            stop

        # Get parent forum
        set {_forum} to parent of {_post}

        # Get solved tag
        set {_solvedTag} to tag named "solved" from {_forum}

        if {_solvedTag} is not set:
            reply with "❌ This forum doesn't have a 'solved' tag!"
            stop

        # Add solved tag to post
        add {_solvedTag} to tags of {_post}

        # Rename post to show it's solved
        set {_currentName} to discord name of {_post}
        set discord name of {_post} to "[SOLVED] %{_currentName}%"

        reply with "✅ Post marked as solved!"
```

### Auto-Tag Posts

```applescript
on thread create:
    # Check if thread is in a forum
    set {_parent} to parent of event-channel

    if {_parent} is a forum channel:
        # Get initial message content
        retrieve messages from event-channel and store them in {_msgs::*}
        set {_content} to first element of {_msgs::*}

        # Auto-tag based on keywords
        if {_content} contains "bug":
            set {_tag} to tag named "bug" from {_parent}
            if {_tag} is set:
                add {_tag} to tags of event-channel

        else if {_content} contains "how" or {_content} contains "?":
            set {_tag} to tag named "question" from {_parent}
            if {_tag} is set:
                add {_tag} to tags of event-channel
```

### Forum Statistics

```applescript
command /forumstats <forum>:
    trigger:
        set {_forum} to arg-1
        set {_threads::*} to threads of {_forum}

        # Count posts
        set {_postCount} to size of {_threads::*}

        # Count by tag
        clear {_tagCounts::*}
        loop {_threads::*}:
            set {_postTags::*} to tags of loop-value
            loop {_postTags::*}:
                set {_tagName} to discord name of loop-value-2
                add 1 to {_tagCounts::%{_tagName}%}

        # Build statistics embed
        make embed:
            set title of embed to "Forum Statistics"
            set description of embed to "Stats for %discord name of {_forum}%"

            add field named "Total Posts" with value "%{_postCount}%" to fields of embed

            # Add tag breakdown
            if {_tagCounts::*} is set:
                clear {_tagList::*}
                loop {_tagCounts::*}:
                    add "%loop-index%: %loop-value%" to {_tagList::*}
                add field named "Posts by Tag" with value join {_tagList::*} with nl to fields of embed

            set embed color of embed to blue

        reply with last embed
```

### Thread Information Display

Show detailed information about a forum post using the new thread expressions:

```applescript
command /threadinfo:
    trigger:
        # Verify we're in a thread/forum post
        if event-channel is not a thread channel:
            reply with "❌ This command only works in forum posts or threads!"
            stop

        # Create dropdown with tag management options
        set {_dropdown} to new dropdown with id "tag_action"
        set placeholder of {_dropdown} to "Select an action..."
        set min range of {_dropdown} to 1
        set max range of {_dropdown} to 1

        add new option with value "create" named "Create New Tag" with reaction "➕" to options of {_dropdown}
        add new option with value "list" named "List All Tags" with reaction "📋" to options of {_dropdown}
        add new option with value "remove" named "Remove Tag" with reaction "➖" to options of {_dropdown}

    if event-dropdown is "tag_action":
        set {_choice::*} to selected values
        set {_action} to first element of {_choice::*}

        if {_action} is "list":
            set {_forum} to forum with id "FORUM_ID"
            # Get available tags somehow
            reply with "Tag list feature coming soon!"

        else if {_action} is "create":
            # Would need modal to get tag details
            reply with "Create tag feature - use modal for input"
```

## Best Practices

<Steps>

1. **Organize with Tags**

   Create clear, descriptive tags that make sense for your community's topics.

2. **Consistent Tag Names**

   Use lowercase, hyphenated names (e.g., "bug-report", "feature-request").

3. **Limit Tag Count**

   Don't create too many tags - it makes categorization confusing. Aim for 5-10 key tags.

4. **Use Emojis Wisely**

   Add relevant emojis to tags for quick visual identification.

5. **Pin Important Posts**

   Use Discord's pin feature for frequently referenced posts.

6. **Archive Old Posts**

   Consider archiving or closing posts that are resolved or outdated.

7. **Moderate Actively**

   Monitor new posts and help add appropriate tags when users forget.

</Steps>

## Forum Guidelines

Create clear guidelines for your forum users:

```applescript
command /forumrules:
    trigger:
        make embed:
            set title of embed to "📋 Forum Guidelines"
            set description of embed to "Please follow these rules when creating posts:"

            add field named "1. Clear Titles" with value "Use descriptive titles that summarize your post" to fields of embed
            add field named "2. Appropriate Tags" with value "Always add relevant tags to help others find your post" to fields of embed
            add field named "3. Search First" with value "Check if your question has been answered before" to fields of embed
            add field named "4. Mark as Solved" with value "When you get an answer, mark your post as solved" to fields of embed
            add field named "5. Be Respectful" with value "Treat all community members with respect" to fields of embed

            set embed color of embed to blue

        reply with last embed
```

## Troubleshooting

### Can't Get Tags

**Problem:** Tag returns null or not found.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the tag name matches exactly (case-sensitive)
- Ensure you're getting the tag from the correct forum
- Check that the tag was actually created on Discord
- Confirm the tag exists in Server Settings > Channels > Forum > Tags

### Can't Add Tag to Post

**Problem:** Adding tag to thread fails.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the thread is actually a forum post (not a regular thread)
- Ensure the tag exists in the parent forum
- Check bot has `MANAGE_THREADS` permission
- Confirm the forum allows multiple tags per post

### Posts Not Showing

**Problem:** Created threads don't appear in forum.

**Solutions:**
- Verify the thread was created successfully
- Check that it wasn't automatically archived
- Ensure bot has `CREATE_PUBLIC_THREADS` permission
- Look in "Archived" section of the forum

### Thread vs Post Confusion

**Problem:** Not sure when to use thread vs post terminology.

**Clarification:**
- In forums, **posts** and **threads** are the same thing
- Use `threads of {_forum}` to get forum posts
- Use `thread channel` type for post references
- Both terms work interchangeably in DiSky

## Forum Limits

- **Tags per forum**: 20 maximum
- **Tags per post**: 5 maximum
- **Tag name**: 1-20 characters
- **Post title**: 1-100 characters
- **Forum channels per server**: No specific limit (counts toward total channels)

## Next Steps

- Set up [AutoMod](/guides/guild/automod/) to moderate forum posts
- Track changes with [Audit Logs](/guides/guild/logs/)
- Create [Welcome Screens](/guides/guild/welcome-screen/) for new members
- Build interactive [Components](/guides/interactions/components/) for forum management
