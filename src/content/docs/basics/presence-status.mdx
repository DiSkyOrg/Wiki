Your bot can display custom presence activities and online status, just like regular Discord users. This guide shows you how to customize both.

## Understanding the Difference

- **Presence**: The activity text shown in your bot's profile (e.g., "Playing Minecraft")
- **Status**: The colored indicator next to your bot's avatar (🟢 Online, 🟡 Idle, etc.)

## Presence Activities

Your bot can display what it's currently doing. Discord supports several activity types:

### Activity Types

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Playing">

Shows as "Playing [text]"

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to playing "Minecraft"
```

Result: **Playing Minecraft**

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Listening">

Shows as "Listening to [text]"

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to listening "Spotify"
```

Result: **Listening to Spotify**

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Watching">

Shows as "Watching [text]"

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to watching "YouTube"
```

Result: **Watching YouTube**

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Competing">

Shows as "Competing in [text]"

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to competing "Arena Championship"
```

Result: **Competing in Arena Championship**

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Streaming">

Shows as "Streaming [text]" with a purple "LIVE" indicator

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to streaming "coding" with url "https://twitch.tv/username"
```

Result: **Streaming coding** (with purple indicator)

<Aside type="caution">
  The URL must be from **YouTube** or **Twitch** for the streaming status to work properly.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Online Status

The status indicator appears as a colored circle at the bottom-right of your bot's avatar.

### Available Statuses

| Status | Indicator | Description |
|--------|-----------|-------------|
| `online` | 🟢 Green | Bot is online and active |
| `idle` | 🟡 Yellow | Bot is idle/away |
| `do not disturb` | 🔴 Red | Bot should not be disturbed |
| `offline` | ⚪ Gray | Bot appears offline (won't be shown in member list) |
| `invisible` | None | Bot is online but appears offline |

### Setting Status

<Tabs>
<TabItem label="Online">

```applescript
set online status of bot named "MyBot" to online
```

Your bot appears **online** with a green indicator 🟢

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Idle">

```applescript
set online status of bot named "MyBot" to idle
```

Your bot appears **away** with a yellow indicator 🟡

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Do Not Disturb">

```applescript
set online status of bot named "MyBot" to do not disturb
```

Your bot appears **busy** with a red indicator 🔴

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Offline">

```applescript
set online status of bot named "MyBot" to offline
```

Your bot **appears offline** and won't show in the member list ⚪

<Aside type="caution">
  The bot is still online and functional, but users see it as offline.
</Aside>

</TabItem>
<TabItem label="Invisible">

```applescript
set online status of bot named "MyBot" to invisible
```

Your bot is **online but hidden** - no status indicator shown.

## Complete Examples

### Dynamic Presence in on ready

```applescript
define new bot named "MyBot":
    token: "YOUR_TOKEN"
    intents: default intents

    on ready:
        # Set online status
        set online status of event-bot to online

        # Set presence
        set presence of event-bot to playing "on %size of guilds of event-bot% servers"

        send "&aBot is ready!" to console
```

### Cycling Presences

```applescript
every 30 seconds:
    set {_random} to random integer between 1 and 3

    if {_random} is 1:
        set presence of bot named "MyBot" to playing "Minecraft"
    else if {_random} is 2:
        set presence of bot named "MyBot" to watching "the server"
    else:
        set presence of bot named "MyBot" to listening "commands"
```

### Status Based on Activity

```applescript
command /maintenance [<text>]:
    trigger:
        if arg-1 is "on":
            set online status of bot named "MyBot" to do not disturb
            set presence of bot named "MyBot" to playing "Maintenance Mode"
            send "Bot is now in maintenance mode"
        else:
            set online status of bot named "MyBot" to online
            set presence of bot named "MyBot" to playing "Minecraft"
            send "Bot is back online"
```

### Member Count Presence

```applescript
define new bot named "MyBot":
    token: "YOUR_TOKEN"
    intents: guild members, default intents

    on ready:
        set {_totalMembers} to 0
        loop guilds of event-bot:
            add size of members of loop-value to {_totalMembers}

        set presence of event-bot to watching "%{_totalMembers}% members"
```

## Best Practices

### Presence

1. **Keep it relevant** - Show what your bot actually does
2. **Keep it short** - Long presence texts get truncated
3. **Update dynamically** - Show live stats like server/member count
4. **Don't spam updates** - Limit updates to once every 30+ seconds

### Status

1. **Use online for normal operation** - Default status
2. **Use do not disturb for maintenance** - Signals downtime
3. **Use idle sparingly** - Better for scheduled tasks
4. **Avoid offline/invisible** - Users might think the bot is broken

## Common Patterns

### Server Count

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to playing "on %size of guilds of event-bot% servers"
```

### Help Command

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to listening "/help for commands"
```

### Website Link

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to playing "Visit bot.example.com"
```

### Version Information

```applescript
set presence of bot named "MyBot" to playing "v2.0.0 | /help"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Presence Not Updating

**Possible causes:**
- Bot not fully loaded yet
- Discord API rate limits
- Network issues

**Solution**: Set presence in the `on ready` section and avoid rapid updates.

### Streaming Status Not Purple

The URL must be from YouTube or Twitch:

```applescript
# ✅ Correct
set presence of bot "MyBot" to streaming "coding" with url "https://twitch.tv/user"

# ❌ Wrong - won't show purple indicator
set presence of bot "MyBot" to streaming "coding" with url "https://example.com"
```

### Status Doesn't Change

Make sure you're using the correct syntax:

```applescript
# ✅ Correct
set online status of bot named "MyBot" to idle

# ❌ Wrong
set status of bot named "MyBot" to "idle"
```
